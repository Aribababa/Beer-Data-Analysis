# Beer Data Analysis

*Data analysis applied to a set of crafted beer to measure a variety of parameters as correlation between the styles, IBU scale, Color and Pitch Rate. All the data were obtained from BrewerÂ´s Friends web page [more info](https://www.brewersfriend.com/).*

## Data Context
This is a dataset of 75,000 homebrewed beers with over 176 different styles. Beer records are user-reported and are classified according to one of the 176 different styles. These recipes go into as much or as little detail as the user provided, but there's are least 5 useful columns where data was entered for each: Original Gravity, Final Gravity, ABV, IBU, and Color.
